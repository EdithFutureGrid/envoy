## Directory structure

Top level directories define fastapi apps that use a common auth model

* `admin`: Used for internal API endpoints for administering the server/injecting calculated entities
* `server`: primary implementation of the public API's - eg 2030.5 etc 

docstrings on `__init__.py` should describe the structure in greater detail
